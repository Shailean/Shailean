- ⚡ **Fun fact**: I'm currently living in Spain (in the region of Galicia) in my second year of my career break which started in September 2021. I left my job as a Financial Coach to travel around Colombia, Peru, and Mexico. 

While traveling I started learning Front End Web Development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). I eventually attended an online bootcamp and graduated in September 2022. 

After graduating from bootcamp, I still didn't feel like I had gained enough programming skills so I applied and received a scholarship to Udacity's Full Stack Developer bootcamp from which I am scheduled to graduate in March 2023.
