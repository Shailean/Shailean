### Hi, I'm Shailean (shall-een) ðŸ‘‹

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my Web Development portfolio
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript, Python, and Java (in a Fullstack Development bootcamp)
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on UX Design and coding projects that build my skills in JavaScript
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m always looking for help with CSS and JavaScrip :)
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: my travels and personal finance
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: (https://www.linkedin.com/in/shaileanhardy/)
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm currently in my second year of my career break which started in September 2021. I left my job as a Financial Coach to travel around Colombia, Peru, and Mexico. While traveling I started learning Front End Web Development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). I eventually attended an online bootcamp and graduated in September 2022. I still didn't feel like I had gained enough programming skills so I applied and received a scholarship to Udacity's Full Stack Developer bootcamp from which I am scheduled to graduate in March 2023.
