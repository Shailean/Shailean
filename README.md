### Hi, I'm Shailean! 👋🏾
Pronounced: "shall-een"

- 🔭 I’m currently working on building projects to add to my Web Development portfolio
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript, Python, and Java (in a Fullstack Development bootcamp)
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on UX Design and coding projects that build my skills in JavaScript. I am also keen to collaborate on projects written in Spanish or needing translation from Spanish to English and projects relating to finance
- 🤔 I’m always looking for help with making websites responsive to smaller screens
- 💬 Ask me about: my travels and personal finance tips (I'm an ex Financial Coach)
- 📫 How to reach me:  [![Linkedin Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Shailean-blue?style=flat&logo=Linkedin&logoColor=white)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shaileanhardy/)
- 🙂 Pronouns: she/her

- ⚡ **Fun fact**: I'm currently living in Spain (in the region of Galicia) in the second year of my career break. I left my job as a Financial Coach in September 2021 and started my travels in Colombia, Peru, and Mexico. 

- 🌍 While traveling I started learning Front End Web Development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). I eventually attended an online bootcamp and graduated in September 2022. After graduating from bootcamp, I still didn't feel like I had gained enough programming skills so I applied and received a scholarship to Udacity's Full Stack Developer bootcamp from which I am scheduled to graduate in March 2023.
