### Hi, I'm Shailean (shall-een) 👋

<!--
**Shailean/Shailean** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my Web Development portfolio
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript, Python, and Java (in a Fullstack Development bootcamp)
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on UX Design and coding projects that build my skills in JavaScript
- 🤔 I’m always looking for help with CSS and JavaScrip :)
- 💬 Ask me about: my travels and personal finance
- 📫 How to reach me: (https://www.linkedin.com/in/shaileanhardy/)
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm currently in my second year of my career break which started in September 2021. I left my job as a Financial Coach to travel around Colombia, Peru, and Mexico. While traveling I started learning Front End Web Development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). I eventually attended an online bootcamp and graduated in September 2022. I still didn't feel like I had gained enough programming skills so I applied and received a scholarship to Udacity's Full Stack Developer bootcamp from which I am scheduled to graduate in March 2023.
